# Nationella genomikplattformen

The National Genomics Platform (NGP) is an infrastructure for storing, processing and sharing research and healthcare data across the seven university hospitals and seven universities that are a part of GMS. Using a collaborative national platform also allows for national data standardisation, joint  development of new bioinformatics pipelines and interpretation tools as well as providing a single point of entry for international projects, research and industry partners.

It consists of three main components:

- A data repository (NGP repository or NGPr)
- A data indexer (NGP intelligence or NGPi)
- A cloud-based High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster (NGP commander or NGPc)
